#About this project

Welcome to the "Reddit_Investment_Signals" repository, where we use the popular subreddit r/wallstreetbets to predict stock values of the S&P500.

The S&P500 index is one of the most widely followed stock indices and includes the 500 largest companies in the United States by market capitalisation. Our approach is to use the collective intelligence of the Wall Street Bets community, which consists of private investors who share their thoughts, opinions and trades on the subreddit.

We use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from the subreddit posts and comments, such as sentiments, keywords and stock market tickers. We then use machine learning algorithms to analyse this data and generate stock price forecasts for the S&P500 companies.

Our repository contains code for data collection, pre-processing, modelling and orchestrating the application. For convenience, we also provide pre-processed datasets and trained models. We welcome contributions from the community to improve the accuracy of our forecasts and extend our coverage to other indices, markets or other subreddits.

#How the repo works:

For beginners:
1. Step: Clone the repo
2. Step: Check if the dataset fits your needs
3. Step: Adapt the parameters in Main.py
4. Step: execute Main.py

You only need to work with the main.py !

For advanced usage:
If you are experienced with Machine Learning, you can try out different algorihms, which are already in the ml_algorihms.py. To execute them, feel free  to adapt the organiser.py to your needs. 

Feel free to use your own data, tune parameters, explore machine learning algorithms and beat the market! #toTheMoon
