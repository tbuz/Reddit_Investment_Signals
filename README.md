# Reddit_Investment_Signals

Welcome to the "Reddit_Investment_Signals" repository, where we use the popular subreddit r/wallstreetbets to predict stock values of S&P500 stocks.

The S&P500 index is one of the most widely followed equity indices and includes the top 500 companies in the United States by market capitalization. Our approach is to leverage the collective intelligence of the Wall Street Bets community, which consists of retail investors who share their thoughts, opinions, and trades on the subreddit.

We use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from the subreddit posts and comments, such as sentiment, keywords, and stock tickers. We then use machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and generate forecasts of stock prices for the S&P500 companies.

Our repository includes code for data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and orchestration of the application. We also provide preprocessed datasets and trained models for convenience. We encourage contributions from the community to improve the accuracy of our predictions and expand our coverage to other indices, markets or other subreddits.

Disclaimer: Our forecasts are solely based on data analysis and do not constitute financial advice. We recommend that you conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.
